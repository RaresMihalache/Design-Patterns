# Behavioral Design Patterns:

Behavioral patterns describe how classes and objects interact & communicate with each other.

### Examples in real life ?

When working with Servlets, we are using Chain of Responsability. All the Servlet Filters follow this DP.
When working with Collections in Java, we are using the Iterator DP.
Observer and Visitor are some of the most used DPs, because they solve very specific problems that are very common.
